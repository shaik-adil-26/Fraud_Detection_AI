# 🛡️ Fraud Detection AI (K-Means Clustering)

An Industry-Style Machine Learning Pipeline built using **Python**, **Scikit-Learn**, and **Streamlit** to detect suspicious transactions using **Unsupervised Learning (K-Means Clustering)**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project simulates a fraud detection system that:

1. Generates raw transaction data  
2. Cleans and preprocesses the dataset  
3. Trains a K-Means clustering model  
4. Deploys an interactive Streamlit web application  
5. Predicts whether a transaction is **Normal** or **Suspicious**

## 🧪 Dataset Features

| Feature | Description |
|----------|------------|
| Amount | Transaction Amount |
| Items | Number of Items Purchased |
| Distance_km | Delivery Distance |

---

## 📊 Fraud Detection Logic

- K-Means divides transactions into clusters
- Cluster with highest average transaction amount is treated as suspicious
